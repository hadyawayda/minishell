Tokenizer:
1. Expand variables in tokenizer (under which conditions? Only when space seperated or enclosed in double quotes right?).
2. Limit expansions to only command names and their options and arguments and file names (redirections and operators and command options (only when variables are set with the - character in the env variable i.e. export var1="-l") should not be supported at all).
